//! # The VM interpreter
//! 
//! The Noa virtual machine is a bytecode interpreter.
//! During normal execution of a user function, the vm will sequentially read bytes
//! from the code section of the Ark file and interpret each byte as an instruction
//! (and potentially read an additional set of bytes as instruction operands).
//! Executing an instruction will usually have some effect on the stack, the instruction pointer,
//! or control flow, causing the vm to potentially enter and execute a new function.
//! 
//! The principal method used to interact with the interpreter is [`Vm::call_run`]
//! which calls a [`Closure`] with some specified arguments and immediately begins executing the interpreter.
//! It acts as a higher-level wrapper around [`Vm::call`] which is the core function used to handle calling functions,
//! which itself delegates to two other functions, [`Vm::call_user`] and [`Vm::call_native`]
//! depending on whether the provided function is a user or native function.
//! 
//! ## The execution root
//! 
//! When calling a function from outside the context of the vm (e.g. from main.rs),
//! the context is called the "execution root". This isn't as much a stack frame as it is
//! a way to refer to the call stack being empty, which is only the case when a function is called like this.
//! Returning from a user function called from the execution root acts much like returning back into
//! a native function, since that is essentially what it does.
//! 
//! ## Calling user functions
//! 
//! A user function is a function defined as a sequence of bytecode instructions.
//! It is the main kind of function the interpreter executes, and is what most of it is dedicated to.
//! 
//! When [`Vm::call_user`] is called, the vm will begin setting itself up for executing the provided closure.
//! This involves pushing the closure captures object onto the stack, preparing the stack with placeholder values
//! for the locals of the function, setting the instruction pointer, and pushing a new stack frame onto the call stack.
//! 
//! Unless there's a bug in the vm, the stack will roughly look like this when calling [`Vm::call_user`]:
//! 
//! ```
//! [ ..., closure, arg1, arg2, arg3 ]
//! ```
//! 
//! The closure will be the first thing pushed onto the stack, followed by the arguments in sequential order.
//! 
//! Within the metadata of a function, the *arity* of the function is specified,
//! i.e. how many arguments the function expects,
//! and the vm needs to respect this in order to not put the stack in an bad state.
//! The way this is done is by pushing [`Value::Nil`] onto the stack until there are enough arguments,
//! or popping values until there are enough.
//! 
//! After the stack has been set up, the vm calculates the stack start index of the function,
//! which is the index within the stack which represents the start of function's own little slice of the stack
//! where its arguments, captures object, and locals will live.
//! 
//! After calling [`Vm::call_user`], the stack will look roughly like this:
//! 
//! ```
//! [ ..., closure, arg1, arg2, arg3, captures, local1, local2, local3 ]
//! //             ^
//! //     stack start index
//! ```
//! 
//! Note that the closure is still on the stack right before the stack start index.
//! 
//! After this, the vm will construct a new stack frame for the user function,
//! which contains the function's ID, the aforementioned stack start index,
//! the address to which the vm should return to after the user function is done executing,
//! and the [`FrameKind`] of the stack frame (which is always [`FrameKind::UserFunction`]),
//! and push it onto the call stack.
//! 
//! Once everything is set up, the [`Vm::ip`] will be set to the function's specified start address,
//! and the [`Vm::call_user`] is finished.
//! 
//! ## Returning from user functions
//! 
//! Returning from a user function is done from bytecode by interpreting the [`opcode::RET`] instruction.
//! This will return from [`Vm::interpret_instruction`] with [`InterpretControlFlow::Return`] and in turn
//! call [`Vm::ret_user`].
//! 
//! [`Vm::ret_user`] in many ways mirrors [`Vm::call_user`] in that it essentially does the reverse of everything
//! [`Vm::call_user`] set up. [`Vm::ret_user`] begins by popping a value off of the stack to use as the return
//! value of the user function. It then pops the current stack frame off of the call stack,
//! ensuring that it is a user function frame, and retrieving the stack backtrack index from the stack frame.
//! This is done through a neat little hack which relies on the layout of the stack when returning from a user function:
//! 
//! ```
//! // When the function was called from a user function:
//! [ ..., closure, arg1, arg2, arg3, captures, local1, local2, local3, ... ]
//! //             ^
//! //     stack start index
//! 
//! // When the function was called from a native function or the execution root:
//! [ ..., arg1, arg2, arg3, captures, local1, local2, local3, ... ]
//! //    ^
//! // stack start index
//! ```
//! 
//! We want to get rid of everything on the stack related to the user function, including the closure itself.
//! However, there will only be a closure on the stack if the function was itself called from a user function.
//! The logic here is therefore that the index on the stack to backtrack to when returning is the
//! index before ths stack start index *if called from a user function*, otherwise it is just the stack start index.
//! 
//! After the stack has been reset, the [`Vm::ip`] is set to the [`Frame::ret`] of the previous stack frame,
//! if it's not [`None`]. In the case that it is [`None`], the function must've been called from the
//! execution root or a native function, so there's no need to set the instruction pointer to anything.
//! 
//! ## Calling native functions
//! 
//! Calling native function is in many ways similar to calling a user function, but different in some crucial ways
//! due to having to call into native code. Native functions naturally do not execute any bytecode,
//! instead they have to interrupt normal execution of bytecode and instead execute a native Rust function.
//! 
//! A problem, however, arises when considering that native functions may want to call back into user code,
//! because this requires pausing execution of the native function and returning into user code.
//! I initially experimented with representing native functions as state machines to allow simply pausing
//! them, but it turned out to be way too complex. Instead, native functions calling user code is implemented
//! using simple recursion. A native function can call [`Vm::call_run`] and provide its own closure and arguments,
//! which will execute whatever function was specified by interpreting bytecode.
//! 
//! [`Vm::call_native`] is fundamentally different from [`Vm::call_user`] in that [`Vm::call_native`] will return
//! the return value of its called function, while [`Vm::call_user`] returns by pushing a value onto the stack.
//! [`Vm::call_native`] will also push a stack frame onto the call stack only for the duration of the execution
//! of the native function and immediately pop it afterwards. It also doesn't account for any superfluous arguments
//! to the function since native function may be variadic,
//! instead passing a vector of the raw arguments to the native function.
//! 
//! ## Temporary stack frames
//! 
//! Temporary stack frames ([`FrameKind::Temp`]) exist as a consequence of Noa being expression-oriented
//! (and the compiler not being very smart lol). The compiler cannot know how big the stack will be
//! when breaking or continuing from a loop, since the `break` or `continue` statement might
//! be inside some other expression like `1 + break`. In this example, `1` will be on the stack when breaking,
//! essentially being garbage data. To remedy this, when entering a loop, the [`opcode::ENTER_TEMP_FRAME`]
//! opcode will be emitted, which signifies to push a temporary stack frame onto the call stack,
//! and when exiting a loop, the [`opcode::EXIT_TEMP_FRAME`] opcode is emitted which does the reverse.
//! Despite being called the "*call* stack", temporary frames don't really represent a "call" to anything,
//! instead just being a marker on the call stack. For this reason, several places in the interpreter
//! have to account for the current stack frame possibly being a temporary frame.
//! 
//! Entering a temporary stack frame isn't particularly complex, however.
//! Really all that is done is looking up the current *user function* frame to retrieve its index on the call stack,
//! constructing an almost identical copy of that frame though with a different stack start index and kind,
//! and pushing that onto the stack,.
//! 
//! Exiting a temporary stack frame isn't particularly complex either.
//! It just pops the current frame, ensures that it is a temporary frame, and resets the stack back to the frame's
//! stack start index. Note that it *does not* set the instruction pointer, because exiting a temporary stack frame
//! has nothing to do with returning from a function, since they are primarily used for `break`/`continue` within loops.
//! 
//! ## Boundaries
//! 
//! On a small note, [`opcode::BOUNDARY`] exists to catch any missing return statements.
//! [`opcode::BOUNDARY`] is emitted after every function, and its only purpose is to cause an exception
//! if the vm tries to execute it.
