# Dev playground

This project is intended as a simple place to play around with the compiler for development and debugging purposes. Any changes to C# source files or the csproj file in this directory should be git-ignored and not committed. `git update-index --skip-worktree *.cs` is useful for this (and `--no-skip-worktree` to restore).
